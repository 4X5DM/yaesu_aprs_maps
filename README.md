# Yaesu VX-8DR/DE APRS Beacons Map

Yaesu VX-8DR/DE memory parser which puts incoming APRS beacon messages on Google map.

## Overview

I live in Israel near where [tropospheric propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation) over the Mediterranean sea occurs very often. When it occurs, VHF QSOs with Greece and even with more distant countries become possible. I usually use the [William Hepburn's Worldwide Tropospheric Ducting Forecast](http://www.dxinfocentre.com/tropo_eur.html) for propagation predictions and for the practical propagation monitoring I use the APRS capability of my Yaesu VX-8DE transceiver. Often, when the propagation opens I receive APRS beacons from all over Greece and even from Bulgaria.

## Working version

Working version of the project is located here:

[https://4x5dm.github.io/yaesu_aprs_maps/](https://4x5dm.github.io/yaesu_aprs_maps/)

All you need is a memory image file of your VX-8R/DR. Chirp's ```*.img``` files will work fine.

## Plans for future develompent

1. [ ] An option for manually entering current position.
2. [ ] Support for additional Yaesu HT models.
